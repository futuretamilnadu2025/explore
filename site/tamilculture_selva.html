                <h4>What is Tamil Culture?</h4>
                <p style="padding:10px;"></p>
                <!-- <h3 align="center">This Month's Promotions</h3> -->
                <p>The external manifestations of Tamil culture may be found in the songs and dances, in the cuisine and dress forms, in the customs and rituals of the Tamil people. But, as always, the external and the internal go together. The earliest literature that we have in Tamil, the Eight Anthologies, was itself classified into two main groups: 'internal' (aham) and 'external' (puram). </p>
                <br>
                <p>If culture is the distilled essence of the way of life of a people, then, in the case of the Tamil people, the distillation process has covered a time span of more than two thousand years. And, today, the Tamil people, living in many lands and across distant seas acquire strength from the richness of their own cultural heritage - not only because that that culture has something to do with their own roots and their way of life but also because they believe that that culture has a significant contribution to make to the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Five decades ago, Czech Professor Dr. Kamil.V. Zvelebil writing in 'Tamil Culture' made an appeal under the heading "The Tamil Contribution to World’s Civilisation". He said: <br>
                <strong>"There is no doubt that the culture of the Tamils belongs to the great and immortal treasures of the world's civilisation." </strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>The following works of art and literature are among the most remarkable contributions of the Tamil creative genius to the world's cultural treasure and should be familiar to the whole world and admired and beloved by all in the same way as the poems of Homer, the dramas of Shakespeare, the pictures of Rembrandt, the cathedrals of France and the sculptures of Greece.</p>
                <br>
                <p><ol>
                <li>The ancient Tamil lyrical poetry compiled in ‘The Eight Anthologies’; this poetry is so unique and vigorous, full of such vivid realism and written so masterfully that it can be compared probably only with some of the pieces of ancient Greek lyrical poetry.</li>
                <li>The Thirukural, one of the great books of the world, one of those singular emanations of the human heart and spirit which preach positive love and forgiveness and peace.</li>
                <li>The epical poem Cilappathikaram, which by its "baroque splendour', and by the charm and magic of its lyrical parts belongs to the epic masterpieces of the world.</li>
                <li>The school of Bhakti both Vaishnava and Saiva, which is one of those most sincere and passionate efforts of man to grasp the Absolute; and its supreme literary expression in the works of Manikkavasagar, Tirugnana Sambandar, Nammalwar and Andal.</li>
                <li>The philosophical system of Saiva Sidhdhantha, a system, which may be ranked among the most perfect and cleverest systems of human thought.</li>
                <li>The South Indian bronzes of the Chola period, those splendid and amazing sculptures belonging to the best creations of humanity.</li>
                <li>The Dravidian temple architecture, of which the chief representatives are perhaps the temples of Tanjore, Chidambaram and Madurai.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>To those contributions, may be added the Classical Dance of the Ancient Tamils - the Bharatha Natyam and the poetic works of  Maha Kavi Subramaniya Bharathy and Kaviyarasu Kannadhasan, which are being recognised today as ranking with the best in the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tamil culture is a culture of great antiquity and it has made, and will continue to make, a rich contribution to world civilisation. That is not to say that Tamils do not need to address the evils of the caste system that has divided them as a people. They do. And it is not to say that Tamils do not need to address the evils perpetuated on women in their society. They do. Professor Hart was right to point out in the Forum on Brahminism & the Tamil Nation</p>
                <p>"..Yes, of course Brahmins have had their own political agenda to push. They have been responsible for many things that I feel are entirely unconscionable. But is this any different from the other high castes? I have heard many many stories of high non-Brahmin castes killing and abusing Dalits. You can't blame the Brahmins for this. In fact, the most pernicious example of the caste system was in the Tamil areas of Sri Lanka, where there are virtually no Brahmins and never have been....Tamil culture has not suffered because of one group. It has suffered because of the caste system and because of its treatment of women... Let's promote inter caste marriage, let's get rid of dowry and give women independence and self-respect, and above all, let's avoid a victimization complex which only plays into the hands of those who have a vested interest in continuing the inequities that exist in Tamilnad. If every Brahmin were to disappear from Tamilnad, the Dalits and others who are exploited would benefited not one iota..."</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tamils have gained, and continue to gain, by their interaction with other peoples and other cultures - particularly those of the Indian sub continent. No people are an island unto themselves. Chauvinism does not advance the culture of a people. The words of the Tamil poet Kanniyan Poongundran in Purananuru (Poem 196), written two thousand years, serve as a useful reminder of the truth of that which Frantz Fannon wrote - "..It is at the heart of national consciousness that international consciousness lives and grows. And this two-fold emerging is ultimately the source of all culture...".</p>

                <p>‘Tamil’ means ‘sweetness’ and ‘Culture’ has been defined as ‘sweetness and light’. ‘Tamil’ and ‘Culture’, therefore, make a most graceful combination both in Language and Life. It is this graceful combination that has brought us here this evening.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What is Culture?</h4>
                <p>Culture has been defined as a ‘way of life’, as ‘sweetness and light’, as ‘activity of thought and receptiveness to beauty and humane feeling’. These brief definitions are sufficient to show the comprehensiveness and the indispensability of culture, for one must have a way of life, and that way of life should be combined with sweetness and light, with activity of thought, and with beauty and humane feeling.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tamil Culture is nothing else but the Tamil way of life, a pattern of gracious living that has been formed during the centuries of Tamil history. It has been conditioned by the land, the climate, the language, the literature, the religions, the customs, the laws, the food, the games and toys of the Tamil people, by the palmyra palm, the gingelly oil, and the vegetables associated with them. Culture is a most elusive and at the same time an all-embracing term.</p>
                <p>Tamil literature has made certain definite contributions to world thought and letters. Its love poetry and its inclusion of love poetry in its theory of poetics are indications of the humanistic approach to life that is characteristic of Tamil culture. The love poetry of the Tamils is the product of a people among whom the finest ideals or fourtship and wedlock had long been cherished. The ethical poetry of the Tamils has been the wonder of all foreigners who have studied it. The maxims of Thiruvalluvar or the Tirukkural is a book of which Dr.Albert Schweitzer has said:<br>
                ‘There hardly exists in the literature of the world a book which contains such lofty maxims.’
                And Dr.Pope observed:
                ‘I have felt sometimes as if there must be a blessing in store for a people that delight so utterly in compositions thus remarkably expressive of a hunger and thirst after righteousness.’
                <br><br>
                If English be the language of commerce, French the language of diplomacy, Italian the language of love, and German the language of philosophy, then Tamil is the language of devotion. The devotional poetry in Tamil is so great in bulk, and in depth and intensity of emotional fervour, that its continued study has given the language a certain aptitude for the expression of themes pertaining to mysticism and contemplation. The Nature poetry of the Tamils is again the result of a people who lived intimately with Nature. No people, except perhaps the people of the Pacific Islands, have made so much use of flowers and plants in daily life for various purposes as the Tamils have done. The Tamils said it flowers not only in love but also in warfare. The ancient Tamil warriors went to battle, their brows decked with garlands, and each strategic movement had its own symbolic flower.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Ideals of Life</strong><br>
                Tamil literature was the result of the Weltanschauung, the world outlook of the Tamil-speaking peoples, and at the same time that literature kept alive the outlook and those ideals which shaped it. Imagination is a gift which has been associated with great commercial peoples, and no people in this part of the world were such skilful navigators or traders as the Tamils.
                <br><br>
                The sea ports of the then Tamil country, which included all the Malabar coast as well, were busy ports of call into which ships from the West sailed with their gold, lamps, wine and goblets, to return home laden with pepper and silks and cotton and ivory, and with the pearls of the Tamil seas. Teak from the Tamil country has been found in the ruins of Ur of the Chaldees, and peacocks and apes of the South were sold abroad as early as Solomon’s time. Yavanar, or men of the Greco-Roman world, established colonies and trading stations in the Tamil kingdoms, and were even employed as engineers, body guards, palace guards and city guards in the service of Tamil kings.
                <br><br>
                The Tamil Argonauts turned their eyes even more naturally towards the East and with them they carried their art and architecture, their religion, their language and their laws. It is agreed by most writers on Indian influences on South East Asia that the Tamil kingdoms were among the earliest and the most active.
                <br><br>
                The tradition of bakthi and the ideal of tolerance explain the fact that nearly every world religion can claim in Tamil, a voluminous literature. Tamil culture has been enriched by poetical works of Saivaites, of Vaishnavaites, of Jains, of Buddhists, of Muslims, of Catholics, of Protestants. No other language in the world has been the vehicle of the epic poetry of so many different religions, not Latin, not Sanskrit.
                <br><br>
                As the ideal of the philosopher-statesman was outlined by the Greeks, as the orator was delineated by the Latins, the courtier and governor by the English, the Tamils conceived their educational ideal as the complete man, the perfect man (saanron) endowed with honor, greatness, culture, benevolence, and grace.
                <br><br>
                Further, a life of altruistic love was recommended to every Tamil. It has been found that persons dedicated to service and love live longer than others, and probably it is the altruism of Tamil culture.<br>
                ‘Thamakkena vaazhaa pirakuriyaLan’<br>
                ‘En kadan paNi seithu kidappathe’<br>
                that explains its long survival.<br>

                <h3>Present Tamil Culture</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px;"></p>
                <p>When one examines the present state of the Tamil-speaking peoples and their fidelity to the ideals that moulded their culture one wonders if they have not lost a great deal of the virility and resource that characterized them of old. It is true they continue to live, to be theistic, and to have a love of the language and literature that nurtured them, but enterprise, initiative, creative activity and philosophic thought are necessary to them, if they are not to be noted for inertia and apathy. Some of their ancient contemporaries are no more; the Chams and the Khmers with whom they traded and who under their inspiration erected colossal monuments are themselves spent forces in the world of today. Unless we are alive to the needs for the conservation and transmission of this culture, it may well be that a few centuries hence we shall have precious little of this heritage left behind in the country of our birth.</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>As the basis and source of this apathy and inertia, I would point to the ignorance of the language, of the literature, of the arts, of the history, of the culture, that exists among our people today, especially among those sections that combine wealth and influence and a lop-sided Western education. Cultures disappear by those very causes by which they flourish, and the disappearance of the ideals that nourished Tamil culture will eventually lead to the disappearance of Tamil culture itself.</li>
                    <li>The dearth of philosophic thought is, perhaps, the greatest drawback in the popularizing of true values. In the spate of talk and oratory about our past glories, we run very dry concerning the problems that affect us in the domain of thought, concerning our beliefs, our code of right and wrong, our political creeds, our ideals of service, our national unity. Philosophy is not the peculiar business of the angels; it is human business, everybody’s business.</li>
                    <li>A lack of originality is seen in the Tamil radio, the Tamil films, and the Tamil newspapers. It is also visible (or audible) in the platform oratory that is being developed in a manner so that the sense follows the sound; it is audible in the alien Tamil accent that is heard over Radio; in the hybrid imitations that pass for Tamil dance, and in the poor norms of appreciation of Tamil music.</li>
                    <li>The emphasis hitherto in the Tamil Renaissance has been on the study of literature. An equal emphasis is necessary today on the Fine Arts of the Tamils. We have not produced recently any great sculptor or any great painter. It is by a revival of these arts that we shall teach our people the art of life and the art of gracious living. A very famous English writer on the Tamil dance wrote to me sometime ago from Canada: ‘I would give anything to have a glimpse of a Pallava sculpture or a Chola bronze.’ It requires an esthetic mind to be so moved by art.</li>

                </ol>
                <br><br>
                I have no intention of continuing these observations because I see at the same time a few signs of an awaking of effective interest in our cultural heritage. But the question that agitates our minds today, the mind of every Tamil-speaking citizen be he Muslim or Hindu, Catholic or Protestant, or Buddhist, concerns the future of Tamil culture in this country.

                    The stagnation in Tamil culture that has been noted before is not a little due to the want of State patronage during the last three or four hundred years. With the dawn of a new era in our national life, it is not legitimate for us to expect the State to extend the same measure of support to the development of the culture of the two major nationalities.
                    <br><br>
                    In the formation and preservation of nationalities, language is by far the most objective factor. It is the free inter-communication of common speech that provides the consciousness of kinship. Language is the rational and spiritual matrix in which a culture lives, moves and has its being. Hence the Tamil poets have consistently lost themselves in a mystical enthusiasm over the nature of the language, calling it the sweetest possible names:
                    senthamizh, inthamizh, vanthamizh, thandamizh, arunthamizh, pasunthamizh, eluzhnthamizh, theenthamizh, uyarthamizh, kothilthamizh, ondamizh.
                    <br><br>
                    The use of the Tamil language in the civil, educational and social life of this country is an absoloute necessity if Tamil culture is to survive. Words are the living memorials in which are enshrined much of social and political history. The inner life of every people is stereotyped in their language, and retained there for the instruction of future generations.It is but a fundamental and human right that Tamil be one of the languages of administration all over the country so that the Tamil-speaking population may transact their business with Government is attended to by members of the Government service who have a minimum knowledge of the Tamil language.

            <h3>Future of Tamil Culture</h3>
            <p style="padding:10px;"></p>
            <p>If a language is to be the matrix of a flourishing and progressive culture, it is necessary that it be taught at a university level both as a language and as a medium. Making no suggestion here with regard to the time when our national languages may be introduced into the university or about the preparation needed for its introduction. Nor minimizing the importance of a high standard of English desirable at our universities, but if we wish to develop our languages and our literatures for modern needs and the expression of modern thought, such a development is inconceivable without the national languages becoming the medium in which our intelligentsia think and write, speak and teach. Even for the success of the national languages medium in the elementary and secondary schools, it would seem that a literature at a university level of thought is a prior requisite. So too it is a prior requisite for the progress of all technicalized means of mass communication like the press, the radio and the cinema. The history of the great Buddhist universities and the Hindu mutts of the neighboring continent, as well as the history of universities in other parts of the world, should convince us of the creative influence exercised by these institutions of higher learning in the transmission of language and culture in the development of the mother tongue.
            <br><br>
            The existence of the age-long cultures side by side should be looked upon as a source of fruitfulness and mutual benefits. Hence our universities, schools, and adult educational agencies should provide opportunities for the study for the study of the two national languages. Citizens should be encouraged to learn the other national language so that they may break the language barrier in the interests of social harmony.

                <h4>The ways and means</h4><br>
                There are ways and means by which individuals may promote Tamil culture, either singly or in a body. It would not be wrong to say that the state or the universities receive their tone and their standards also from the society, the higher is the standard of cultural patronage by the state and of efficiency at the university. Here are some ways and means by which the objectives of a cultural revival may be achieved:<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Active support should be given to associations dedicated to the study and promotion of Tamiliana.</li>
                    <li>Tamil society should set the highest standards in this revivalist and progressive movement. Awards (cash, medals, books) should be offered for creative work and for translations.</li>
                    <li>Libraries and museums should be established as means of adult education and films should be made of the Tamil heritage.</li>
                    <li>A comprehensive Tamil-English dictionary and a Tamil Encyclopedia should be compiled.</li>
                    <li>Basic research should be undertaken by cultural associations so that the significance and import of Tamil customs and habits and way of life may be popularized among the Tamil speaking people.</li>
                    <li>Teachers of Tamil should be well qualified and be lovers of Tamil literature that enjoy Tamil poetry in their leisure. A new orientation in the prescribing of books of study and in their teaching is necessary if Tamil children are to love their language and enjoy poetry and the Tamil arts as the expression of life and experience, and wield their language for intelligent and effective citizenship. The writing of poetry should receive especial attention, since poetry, more than any other fine art, is a powerful vehicle for the transmission of a people’s ideals, history and language. Our folk dances and folk songs should be fostered.</li>
                    <li>Tamil monuments should be better studied and preserved. If the state for some reason or other, has not hitherto prepared specialists in Tamil archeology or Tamil history, it should be the duty of the Tamil cultural associations to request the state to do so. The university, the Department of Archeology, the Public Museums should have scholars well versed in Tamilian. Scholarships may be offered to deserving students by the Tamil-speaking public.</li>
                    <li>Tamil studies should be made to show the points of contact and elements,so as to promote understanding and national solidarity.</li>
                    <li>The contribution in thought, in literature, in art made by the Tamil-speaking people should be made known through translations in the principal languages of Europe and Asia, because that contribution is part of the world’s heritage. In the past, for political and religious reasons, Tamil studies had enthusiastic students in Portugal, Holland, France and England. In the future, it will be the duty of Tamils themselves to give their treasures to their fellowmen, and a few Tamil scholars at least should learn Hindi, Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian for this purpose.</li>
                    <li>Culture is dependent for its origin and its development on geography and on the land. Tamil culture has had always an intimate communion with the land as is to be seen from the earliest Tamil poetry down to our own day. The tendency of people to flock to the towns should be arrested, for extreme urbanization and the consequent change means death to a culture such as ours. One cannot be opposed to change or to the absorbing elements that are conducive to cultural progress. But the process of change should not involve the ceasing of a vital internal development. The Tamil-speaking people should cooperate in colonization programs and revive the agricultural bias of their social structure.</li>
                    <li>Every Tamil-speaking citizen should make his own contribution to this cultural movement, by study, by doing promotional work, and by material assistance. Many associations and authors fail to give of their best for want of adequate finances.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Unto the Last</strong><br><br>
                These, Ladies and gentlemen, are some of the measures that we may adopt in order that we may reacquire our culture for ourselves and our generation, and that we may leave it to those who follow us, richer and nobler, if possible, than we found it. There is no doubt that the task of nation-building is not a light one, and that the problems that beset us are many and varied. While other bilingual states are parts of continents and have large territories contiguous to them, Nature and history and a common patrimony intend us to be one nation in our island home. Because Tamil is the mother tongue also in other countries, no Tamil-speakin has ever ceased to think of this but as his home, his country and his motherland. For two thousand years and more, our two major nationalities have lived together, and there is no reason for hot hoping that culture will be a source of inspiration and strength to Tamil culture and that Tamil culture will be a source of inspiration and strength to culture. Asia today throbs with the consciousness of a new hope and destiny, and within the frame work of a new world, our country situated in the center between East and West has the new opportunity to evolve a life of its own, her own democracy, by learning from the experience of other nations on either side of her but by solving her own problems in the manner best suited to her own national genius.
                <br><br>
                While it is true that a culture may not be created artificially, it is equally true that it is in the power of men to contribute to the causes and work at those conditions necessary for a flowering of culture, and it is also in the power of men to combat those intellectual errors and the emotional prejudices which stand in the way of such conditions. The survival and the continued growth of Tamil culture is, therefore, in our hands.
                <br><br>
                It is selfless and noble to dedicate one’s time and energies under God to one’s culture and one’s country. The Tamil sage implied that Tamil culture is the dearest possession of the Tamil people for the preservation of which no sacrifice would be great enough, not even life itself:<br>
                    <p class="para_center">"Panpudaiyaar paddundu ulagam<br>
                    Ahhthinrael mannpukku Maaivathuman."<br></p>
